- Number: Floating point number -> Used for decimals and integers
  - ``` js let age=25; ```
- String: Sequence of characters -> Used for text ``` let firstName="John"; ```
- Boolean: Logical type that can be only ture or false -. Used for talking decisions ```js let fullAge=ture; ```
- Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value') -> ```js let children; ```
- Null: Also means 'empty value'
- Symbol(ES2020): Value that is unique and cannot be changed [Not usefull for now]
